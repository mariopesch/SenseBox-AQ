# SenseBox:Airquality
The SenseBox:Airquality will be an update for the SenseBox. Working with an Arduino Mega. First Prototyp for my Bachelor Thesis
Sensors:
- OLED Display --> I2C
- BMP280 --> I2C
- HDC100x Temperatur and Humidity Sensor (http://www.watterott.com/de/HDC1008-Breakout) --> I2C
- Shinyei PPD42 --> Pin 18/19
- MH-Z14 Infrared CO2 Sensor --> A12(66)/A13(67)
- Grove Multichannel Gas Sensor I2C MiCS6814

See some picture's in the Sketch folder. Build a simple "rainproof" Case and adding a fan to make sure that the airflow is good.
