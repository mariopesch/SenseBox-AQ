# senseBox-AQ
The senseBox-AQ will be an update for the senseBox. Working with an Arduino Mega. It's just a Prototype for my Bachelorthesis at the moment. Working on new Sensor for measuring NOx- (MiCS2714) and O3-Konzentration(MiCS2614)

Sensors:
- GPS to A14/15 (GPS is not implement in the sketch at the moment)
- OLED Display --> I2C
- BMP280 --> I2C
- HDC100x Temperatur and Humidity Sensor (http://www.watterott.com/de/HDC1008-Breakout) --> I2C
- Shinyei PPD42 --> Pin 18/19
- MH-Z14 Infrared CO2 Sensor --> A12(66)/A13(67)

See some picture's in the Sketch folder. Build a simple "rainproof" Case and adding a fan to make sure that the airflow is good.
